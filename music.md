Here is where we talk about music. I started learning music production in 2013 and have made hundreds of tunes/ditties that are not worth sharing, mostly unfinished. I would love to collaborate with pretty much anyone. 

*Dedicated to Nick, Ben, Sam and Noah*

Here are two playlists. 

This playlist is recent work.

This playlist is quite old, but I picked out some tracks from all of the tracks I made when learning that I thought were alright. The actual songs were made between 2012 and ~2015 at the latest.

[I also use Bandlab.](https://www.bandlab.com/petermacchapman)
I ran out of space on Soundcloud so have been using Bandlab more and more, instead of deleting tracks on Soundcloud. I haven't used it, but there is an online DAW and I think you can edit with people and record throught the browser. I am always up for collaboration. 

If you are interesting in hearing more, better quality and browsable in the form of google drive link contact me directly. 

``Thanks for listening!``
