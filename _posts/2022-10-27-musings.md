I have trouble decided how much to share online, and where. This domain feels more personal, though that implies lack of anonymity. I'd really like to have a place where I can talk about what I am going through, ugliness and all, but I don't think this is the place. Maybe some sort of anonymous blog. I don't know. I just wanted a place to promote my music and maybe talk a bit about tech. At the the same time, I want to connect with others, and that implies sharing details about ones life.
